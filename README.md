# quantum-computing-bookclub
Repository for knowledge transfere and collaboration on topics discussed during HPI quantum computing bookclub.


## Scope and Goals
This repository is meant to serve as complementary workspace to the quantum cmputing bookclub at HPI. This semester we focus on getting started with quantu computing and follow the overall structure of the [Qiskit Textbook][1].

The goal is to get an overview in basic concepts of quantum computing and some first hands-on experience in quantum programming by working through the qiskit textbook. Once we built up a shared understanding of those concepts the idea is to set individual research focuses and share the findings with each other.


## Schedule
This extracurricular activity is conducted in a hybrid format. We meet be-weekly for synchronized sharings and discussing our next steps.

- Session 0: Introduction, Scope and Goals
- Session 1: Overview IBM experience, Bell-Cirquit (Qiskit Textbook: Sections until 1.2)
- Session 2&3: Some Gates in Detail (Qiskit Textbook: Sections until 2.2)

- Next Session (2022-07-11): Some more Gates in Detail (Qiskit Textbook: Sections until 2.2)


## This Repository
This repository is meant to serve as a complementary workspace. The intention is to focus on the following aspects:
- Collect and share QC related resources with each other, summarize and comment on them
- Collect and share QC related code snippets and comment on them
- Collaborate on the Qiskit Textbook exercises or other QC related projects


## Resources to get you started
We will use the [Qiskit Textbook][1] as primary resource regarding structure and topics. Depending on your interests the following resources might support you in your studies, especially in case you'd like to dive deeper into certain theoretical aspects:

- Yanofsky (2007): [An Introduction to Quantum Computing][2] (english)
- OpenHPI (2020): [Future of Computing - on the Road to Quantum][3] (week 3, self-paced) (english)
- OpenHPI (2022): [Einf√ºhrung in das Quantencomputing - Teil 1][4] (running) (german)
- Wiebe (2021): [Lecture Series on Quantum Computing (Youtube)][5] (self-paced) (english)
- Qiskit Community (2022): [ibm-quantum-spring-challenge-2022][6] (self-paced) (multiple languages)
